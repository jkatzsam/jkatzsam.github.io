# Biography

I am currently a Postdoc at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington working with Kevin Jamieson. I completed my PhD in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan where I worked with Prof. Clayton Scott. Prior to that, I double-majored in mathematics and philosophy at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on pure exploration multi-armed bandits, recommender systems, and nonparametric estimation. I am also interested in applications of machine learning that promote the social good. As a Data Science for Social Good fellow at the University of Chicago in 2015, I helped develop the <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/lid/">Legislative Influence Detector</a>.
